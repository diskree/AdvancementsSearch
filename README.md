# AdvancementsSearch

This is a simple mod that adds search to the advancements window. The search works only by available advancements and searches by names and descriptions of advancements.

The search interface tries to be similar to the search from the creative inventory. Search works as an invisible tab with a black background, and search results are displayed in a grid that adapts to the size of the advancements window.

To go to the advancement you can click on the search result, the advancement will blink until you hover over it.
